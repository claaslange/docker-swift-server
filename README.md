# Swift Docker example

This is an example project running a [Noze.io server](https://github.com/NozeIO/Noze.io) inside a docker 
container using docker compose.

Just run `cp .env.dist .env` and `make start`  and visit http://localhost:5000 afterwards to view the example server.

The example is based on the [http-helloworld example](https://github.com/NozeIO/Noze.io/tree/master/Samples/httpd-helloworld).
